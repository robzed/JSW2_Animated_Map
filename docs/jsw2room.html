<h1>Jet-Set Willy II Room Format</h1>

<h2>Version 0.9.1: 10 December 2005</h2>

<h3>by John Elliott</h3>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I do not guarantee this information
to be correct. This is my best guess at what is going on inside JSW
II, after wandering around inside it with a disassembler.</p>

<p>New for v0.9.1: More notes on CPC versions.</p>

<p>New for v0.9: Some notes on the room format used by CPC6128 JSW, upon
which JSW2 is based.</p>

<p>New for v0.8: Some more details on lifts.</p>

<p>New for v0.7: Added the title screen and music formats.</p>

<p>New for v0.6: Added various game engine limits.</p>

<p>New for v0.5: Corrected various guardian values.</p>

<p>New for v0.4: More corrections from Andrew Cadley.</p>

<p>New for v0.3: Andrew Cadley has supplied details of the T4, CG0
and CG1 bytes.</p>

<h2><a id="1" name="1">1. Terminology</a></h2>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, this document refers to the Spectrum version
of JSW2. Notes of differences in the CPC implementations of JSW1 and JSW2 
(which both appear to use a JSW2ish engine) are prefaced [CPC].</p>

<p>The room layouts in Jet Set Willy I were composed of four
elements:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Air</dt>

<dd>Willy can walk or jump through it, but not stand on it.</dd>

<dt>Water</dt>

<dd>As Air, but Willy can also stand on it.</dd>

<dt>Earth</dt>

<dd>Willy can stand on it, but not walk or jump through it.</dd>

<dt>Fire</dt>

<dd>Willy loses a life if he touches this.</dd>
</dl>

<p>I have retained this system in describing JSW2, although ramps,
conveyors and items are also "elements" now.</p>

<h2><a id="2" name="2">2.Snapshot encryption</a></h2>

<p>All information has been deduced from a snapshot of JSW2 taken
while the title screen was showing and before a game had been
started. JSW2 is encrypted, so .TAP files and snapshots taken
before the title screen appeared will not match this pattern.</p>

<p>[CPC] The formats used by CPC versions come from snapshots taken in a CPC 
emulator in CPC464 mode. I have not made more than a cursory attempt to 
reconcile them with the disc files (JET*.BIN) comprising CPC JSW.</p>

<h2><a id="3" name="3">3. Room entries</a></h2>

<p>JSW2 contains a table of 16-bit pointers to room entries:</p>

<pre>
TABLE: DW  ROOM0
       DW  ROOM1
       ...
  
</pre>
<p><em>For JSW editor authors: This table is at BAFDh in JSW2. But you
	are encouraged not to treat its address as permanent. It is
	between two blocks of compressed data, so it may be useful to 
	move it around as the number of rooms in the game increases or
	decreased. Instead, find the address of this table from the word 
	at 7E69h.</em></p>
<p><em>Similarly, JSW2 has 134 entries in this table. But it's preferable
	to calculate the number of rooms as (ROOM0 - TABLE) / 2, since 
	there's no game-specific reason why there shouldn't be more or
	fewer entries.</em></p>
<p>[CPC] In the CPC version, this table is at 38B0h (JSW1) / 5C00h (JSW2).</p>

<p>Each room entry is formed:</p>

<pre>
+0  DW  RDATA   ;Address of room shape (Room shapes: <a href="#4">Section 4</a>)
		;In JSW2, the room shapes are stored separately from the rooms,
		;with their own compression system.
+2  DB  HBITS   ;High bits
                ;These are combined with the next 8 bytes to form 9-bit
                ;values. Bit 7 of this byte gives Bit 8 of U0;
                ;    Bit 6 of this byte gives Bit 8 of U1;
                ;        ...
                ;        Bit 0 of this byte gives Bit 8 of U7.
+3  DB  U0      ;Cell pattern for Water (Cell patterns: <a
href="#5">Section 5</a>)
+4  DB  U1      ;Cell pattern for Earth
+5  DB  U2      ;Cell pattern for Fire
+6  DB  U3      ;Cell pattern for "/" ramps
+7  DB  U4      ;Cell pattern for conveyor going left
+8  DB  U5      ;Cell pattern for item
+9  DB  U6      ;Cell pattern for "\" ramp
+A  DB  U7      ;Cell pattern for conveyor going right

    ;[CPC] The CPC version has four additional bytes here. 
    ;Presumably they control the palette registers, since different
    ;rooms appear in different colours.

+B  DB  xname   ;Number of spaces to print before the room name 
                ;(to position it centrally). This also contains
                ;the border colour in bits 2-0.
+C  DB  name    ;Variable-length ASCII string, with bit 7 set on
                ;the last character. Bytes 1-30 are expanded to

                ;same format as the keyword table in the Spectrum
                ;ROM. Note that because bit 7 is set on the last character,
                ;the last character is not in the range 1-30 and is not 
                ;expanded. 
                ; [CPC] The CPC versions do not appear to compress
                ; room names.
    DB  left    ;Exit left  }
    DB  up      ;Exit up    } Room nos.
    DB  right   ;Exit right }
    DB  down    ;Exit down  }
    DB  T4      ;Bit    7: Set if there is a rope in the room
                ;Bit    6: Set to animate conveyor belt. Conveyors can only be
                ;         animated if there is a single conveyor in the room.
                ;         This is because the animation code assumes all 
		;         conveyor cells in the room are contiguous, and draws 
		;         one long animated strip starting at the first 
                ;         conveyor cell in the room.
                ;         
                ;Bit    5: If conveyor belts are animated:

                ;           1: The top and third rows animate. 
                ;Bit    4: If set of T4 is set, byte T5 is present;

;
;End of room
;
</pre>
<p>JSW2 allows a total of eight guardians or arrows in each room.</p>

<h2><a id="4" name="4">4. Room shape</a></h2>

<p>The room shape is stored as a stream of bytes, each describing
one or more character cells. The decompression code continues
expanding until 512 cells been described. Cells are decompressed as
horizontal sequences, starting at the top left corner.</p>

<p>Each byte is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less than 90h: 

<ul>
<li>Bits 0-3 give (number of repetitions - 1)</li>

<li>Bits 7-4 give the cell type (0-8): 

<dl>
<dt>0</dt>

<dd>Air</dd>

<dt>1</dt>

<dd>Water</dd>

<dt>2</dt>

<dd>Earth</dd>

<dt>3</dt>

<dd>Fire</dd>

<dt>4</dt>

<dd>Ramp going northeast ("/")</dd>

<dt>5</dt>

<dd>Conveyor going left</dd>

<dt>6</dt>

<dd>Item. There can be at most 16 items per room. JSW2 doesn't have a global
item table; it uses a table of 16-bit words for each room. Set bits in a 
word correspond to untaken items.</dd>

<dt>7</dt>

<dd>Ramp going northwest ("\")</dd>

<dt>8</dt>

<dd>Conveyor going right</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>90h or more: Cell type is 0. Bits 7-0 give (number of
repetitions + 7Fh).</li>
</ul>

<p>Special arrangements exist for Room 108, the Cartography Room.
Water cells in this room map to rooms in other parts of the game; a
table at 0FBE8h gives the mapping (it starts 74h, 75h, 76h; so the
first water cell depends on room 74h, the second on room 75h, and
the third on room 76h).</p>
<p>[CPC] In CPC JSW1, this table is at 4CE5h. In CPC JSW2, this table is at 
0A700h but does not appear to be populated in the snapshot I'm working from.</p>

<h2><a id="5" name="5">5. 8x8 Cells</a></h2>

<p>Cells have a 9-bit number (see <a href="#2">above</a>). To find
the address of a cell, multiply this number by 9 and add 8C78h
([CPC]: 0B60h for JSW1, 4C00h for JSW2). The cell is then formed: 
one attribute byte, and 8 bitmap bytes.</p>

<p>Bit 7 of the attribute byte means 'inverse' rather than 'flash'. The
game startup code inverts any such cells and clears bit 7. All cells are 
drawn in bright colours, so bit 6 (bright) may also have an alternative 
meaning.</p>

<p>[CPC] The attribute byte behaves differently:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bits 0-1: Foreground colour 0-3</li>
	<li>Bits 2-3: Background colour 0-3</li>
	<li>Bits 4-7: Do not seem to be used</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="6" name="6">6. Guardians</a></h2>

<p>A compressed guardian record is 7 bytes (CG0-CG6):</p>

<pre>
  CG0:  } Limits of movement. When you first enter a room a counter is 
  CG1:  } initialized with the value of CG0, this is decremented on each 
          pass through the game loop. Each time the counter reaches 0 it 
          is reloaded from CG1, the guardian's direction is reversed, and 
          the process begins again.
  CG2:  Low 8 bits of sprite number
  CG3:  Primary movement step (8-bit signed integer). Doubling the movement 
        step makes a sprite go twice as <b>far</b> as well as twice as 
        <b>fast</b>, while reversing its direction swaps the limits of 
        travel over. On horizontal sprites, this also affects the 
        animation step.
  CG4:  Bit    7 is bit 8 of sprite number.  
        Bits 6-0 are initial X coordinate.
  CG5:  Bit    7 is set if the guardian is unidirectional (cf: Megaron).
        Bits 6-0 are initial Y coordinate.
  CG6:  Bits 1-0 is animation mask. This is:
             0: None
             1: Frames 1,2     }
             2: Frames 1,3     } (taking account of reversal, see bit 6)
             3: Frames 1,2,3,4 }
    Bits 3-2 give colour. This is 
             0: White
             1: Yellow
             2: Cyan
             3: Green
                    (A 4-byte table at 70A9h gives these colours. For some
                    reason, unidirectional guardians are always drawn in 
                    white).
    Bits 4-5 give secondary movement step. For horizontal/vertical 
             guardians, this is 0. For a diagonal guardian, if bit 7 is 
             set, this is the vertical step; otherwise, it's the 
             horizontal step.
    Bit 6    is set to swap between frames 0/1/2/3 and 4/5/6/7 when the
             guardian reverses.
    Bit 7    is set to move horizontally, clear to move vertically.
         Combining it with bits 4 and 5 we have:
                 
                 Bit 7  Bit 5  Bit 4
                 ==================================================

                     1      1      1     45 degrees from horizontal
</pre>

<p><a id="#6a" name="#6a">A compressed arrow record is 2 bytes</a>:</p>

JSW II decompresses arrows and guardians to 17-byte guardian records 
(UG00-UG10). Here is how it does it: 

<pre>
  Byte  Meaning  How set
  ====================================================================
  UG00  Arrow    Address of arrow sprite - EB01h or EB21h. 
  UG01  address           if (AB1 &amp; 80h) then EB01h, else EB21h.

                 If a guardian is unidirectional, and either UG04 (X step) is
                 negative, or UG06 (Y step) is strictly positive, then the 
                 guardian isn't drawn.

</pre>

<h2><a id="7" name="7">7. Special-case code.</a></h2>

<p>JSW2 has a table of special-case code at 8361h ([CPC]: 6BC1h for JSW1, 
9BDAh for JSW2), which has two words for each ID. It starts at ID 1:</p>

<pre>
    dw  sc1a    ;For ID=1
    dw  sc1b
    dw  sc2a    ;For ID=2
    dw  sc2b
    ...         ;etc.
   
</pre>

<p>The two routines appear to be an initialisation function and a
function called once every time the game loop is run.</p>

<p>A routine address can be 0 if only one of the two routines is
being supplied.</p>

<p>Special case code IDs are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Central Cavern: If Willy has won, jump on the spot repeatedly.</li>
	<li>Lift 1: Draw lifts using the 1st pair of lift definitions.</li>
	<li>Lift 2: Draw lifts using the 2nd pair of lift definitions.</li>
	<li>Lift 3: Draw lifts using the 3rd pair of lift definitions.</li>
	<li>Lift 4: Draw lifts using the 4th pair of lift definitions.</li>
	<li>The Trouble With Tribbles: Moving floor segments.</li>
	<li>Is not used in Spectrum JSW2, and appears to have no effect.
	[CPC] Doesn't seem to be used in CPC JSW either; curious.</li>
	<li>Rocket Room. When Willy reaches particular coordinates, the 
	central section of the room takes off and Willy is transported to 
	the room above. </li>
	<li>The Bathroom. Draws the toilet. If Willy hits it and the game is 
	won, then move him to room 133 (Central Cavern). Also, make Willy run 
	to the right if the game is won.</li>
	<li>Master Bedroom. Removes Maria if 150 or more items have been 
	collected. If Willy is standing on a right-moving conveyor (ie, the 
	bed) then start him running to the right.</li>
	<li>Beam Me Up/Down Spotty: Enables teleporters to be used in this 
	room.</li>
	<li>Belfry: Draws ropes above vertical guardians.</li>
	<li>Eggoids: Makes diagonal guardians reverse when they hit the top or 
	bottom of the screen.</li>
	<li>The Yacht: Deals with the Yacht sailing away.</li>
	<li>Trip Switch: Handles what happens when Willy touches the Trip 
	Switch. The left conveyor graphic is used for the "off" switch, and 
	the right conveyor for the "on" switch.</li>
	<li>Rigor Mortis: If all items have been taken from room 75, sets the 
	first two guardians in the room to have X steps of -1 and +1, and 
	counter values of 28, respectively.</li>
	<li>Crypt Switch. Adjusts the X step and counter of the first 
	guardian in the room.</li>
	<li>Foot Room. Puts a foot at the top of the room, which drops when
	all items have been taken from room 103.</li>
	<li>Lift 5: Draw lifts using the 6th pair of lift definitions.</li>
	<li>First Landing: Make 'fire' cells flash. Also, make Willy run to 
	the right if the game is won.</li>
	<li>Lift 6: Draw lifts using the 7th pair of lift definitions. Also
	makes fire cells flash.</li>
	<li>Deserted Isle: Handle all the complicated behaviours of that 
	complicated room. Allows teleporters to be used.</li>
	<li>Macaroni Ted: Make Willy run to the right if the game is won.</li>
	<li>Dumb Waiter: Draw lifts using the 5th pair of lift definitions. 
	Also, make Willy run to the right if the game is won.</li>
	<li>Highway to Hell: Moving floor segments. [CPC] CPC JSW does not

	<li>Is not used in Spectrum JSW2, and appears to have no effect.</li>
</ol>
<p>[CPC] In JSW1 for the CPC, most of these are set to zero since they refer to
rooms in the JSW2 extended areas. Those that remain keep the same numbers.</p> 

<h3>Lifts</h3>
<p>This system is used to implement lifts. There is a table of lift 
definitions (in <a href="#6">compressed guardian format</a>) at 0FB30h
([CPC JSW2]: 7A28h). Lifts go around in pairs, like policemen; so the first two 
lifts will be for one room, the next two for the next room, and so on.</p>
<p>Each lift uses a guardian slot; so any room with lifts can only have up
to six guardians.</p>

<h2><a id="8" name="8">8. Teleporters</a></h2>

<p>There are four teleporters in the game; you will find their
definitions at 7435h ([CPC JSW2]: 9698h). A teleporter definition is 6 
bytes long:</p>

<pre>
    DB  from    ;Room to teleport from
    DB  x       ;X location within the room
    DB  y       ;Y location within the room
    DB  to      ;Room to teleport to, plus 1
    DB  x       ;New X location 
    DB  y       ;New Y location
</pre>
<p>Teleporters only work if the special-case number for the room is 11 or 22.

<h2><a id="9" name="9">9. The title screen</a></h2>
<p>The title screen tune is from 0FC69h to 0FCCCh, terminated with 0FFh.
It is in the same format as the
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/andrewbroad/spectrum/willy/music.html">JSW1
	title screen music</a>.</p>

<p>The title screen itself lives between 0FCCDh and 0FE72h, terminated with 
0FFh. Each byte corresponds to one character cell, with the first one at 
x=18, y=2; the next is drawn at x=19, y=2, and so on. A byte has the following 
meaning:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If bit 7 is set: Draw slope. Bit 6 is 0 for a / slope, 
	1 for a \ slope.</li>
	<li>If bit 7 is not set: Leave cell blank.</li>
	<li>Always: Bits 2-0 give ink, bits 5-3 give paper. Bright is always 
	on. Flash is always off, with one exception: If ink=6 and paper=6, 
	you instead get flashing magenta on yellow. This attribute can be
	found at 0FECDh.</li>
</ul>

<p>The four 'slope' graphics live from 0FE73h to 0FE92h. Each is an 8x8
graphic in UDG format. The first two are for a / slope, and the second two 
for a \ slope.</p>

<h2><a id="10" name="10">10. The in-game tune</a></h2>

<p>The in-game tune lives at 0FAF0h and is exactly 64 bytes long. It's in
the same format as the Manic Miner / JSW1 
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/andrewbroad/spectrum/willy/music.html">
	in-game music</a>.</p>
